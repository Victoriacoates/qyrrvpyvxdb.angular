 <input> and <textarea> attributes

All of the attributes that can be used with normal <input> and <textarea> elements can be used on elements inside <mat-form-field> as well. This includes Angular directives such as ngModel and formControl.

The only limitation is that the type attribute can only be one of the values supported by matInput.***

 Supported <input> types

The following input types can be used with matInput:

    color
    date
    datetime-local
    email
    month
    number
    password
    search
    tel
    text
    time
    url
    week

****
 Error: Input type "..." isn't supported by matInput

This error is thrown when you attempt to set an input's type property to a value that isn't supported by the matInput directive. If you need to use an unsupported input type with <mat-form-field> consider writing a custom form field control for it.

Accessibility

The matInput directive works with native <input> to provide an accessible experience.

If the containing <mat-form-field> has a label it will automatically be used as the aria-label for the <input>. However, if there's no label specified in the form field, aria-label, aria-labelledby or <label for=...> should be added.
